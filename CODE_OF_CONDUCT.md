# Code of Conduct

Please be kind. The maintainers of this project, and in particular @Thirdegree, will actively try our best to keep this an open, inclusive, and friendly place to exist. We encourage new and underrepresented members of the python and open source community to contribute and exist in this space. We ask all members of this community to practice empathy and solidarity with our fellows. We ask everyone to remember the human; everyone you speak to here is a person behind the screen, deserving of empathy and compassion.

We additionally ask that we not be forced to further elaborate on this. If necessary we will, but it would be much nicer if that was not required by virtue of the community respecting this space as an inclusive environment.
